# Spatial-Reasoning

## Work done by Kevin Lee (k.lee@nyu.edu)

This repo contains the following content:

* `groundTruth`

> Folder containing the Ground Truth JSON files

* `scripts`

> Folder containing various scripts written during research period.

> These were used to create the topology graphs, RGB histograms, and datasets.

* `VGG16`

> This folder contains the code for the VGG16 based CNN Baseline

> Has both Python file and Notebook

* `ViT_B16_224`

> This folder contains the code for the Vision Transformer Baseline

> Has both Python file and Notebook


### Remarks:

Note that model Notebooks and Python `train.py` are not consistent. The `train.py` are more recently edited.

Only the Notebooks have sample visualizations and Test set results.

For VGG16:

> Planning on retraining on HPC

>> Larger image size

>> Larger batch size

> Also some minor changes

For ViT:

> Needs investigation

>> Does not seem to learn much

>> Experiment with different learning rates

>> Investigate model

> Planning on retraining on HPC

>> Larger batch size
